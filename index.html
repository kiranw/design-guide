			Design is a problem-solving practice. It's one that can This project covers a series of case studies exploring the question: how might we intentionally be our own red teams? How might we design protectively and proactively to consider potential unintended consequences that technology might enable? While this certainly isn't exhaustive, this project aims to build a repository of case studies to help us identify design patterns in the wild and think of new ways to design protectively. 
			<br><br>
			Let's start by learning about <strong><span class="text-emphasis">Poka-Yoke</span></strong>.
			<br><br>
			It's a mistake-proofing method developed by engineer Shigeo Shingo at Toyota to reduce errors made on the manufacturing line.
			While Poka-Yoke's methods are broad and far-reaching, we'll focus on one method in particular.<br><br>
			<img src="img/py2.png" style="height: 300px; display: inline-block; width: auto; bottom: 10%; float: right; right: 0;">
			<strong><span class="text-emphasis">The Contact Method</span></strong>:<br> Use <span class="text-emphasis">physical attributes</span> of something (like its color, size, weight, shape) to prevent misuse. The examples from the last slide, like the electrical socket, follow this.<br><br>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="r1-p2" class="page p2">
		<div class="description">
			If we broaden Poka-Yoke's objectives, how might we use similar <span class="text-emphasis">defensive methods</span> to protect against the often squishier and more nebulous ways technology can lead to harmful outcomes?<br><br>

			Let's consider the invention of the camera. Before the advent of digital imagers for cameras, photography required long exposures of an image onto chemically treated film. Because exposures could take several minutes (even hours), the subject of a photograph needed to stay still for long periods of time, making the photography of passing strangers in public virtually impossible. With digital cameras, exposure was instantaneous.

	<div id="r1-p3" class="page p3">
		<div class="description">
			Portable cameras made capturing private persons easier, and enabled the circulation of private information without consent. Justices Warren and Brandeis <span class="text-emphasis">spoke about this</span><span class="text-emphasis"> in The Right to Privacy. </span><br><br>

			Camcorders made these visual records even richer. But without the option to mute video recordings as they were taken, they became tools that could potentially capture private conversations in the public realm.<br><br>
			<img src="img/Findface.png" style="height: auto; width:100%; margin-bottom: 20px">
			<br><br>
			Now, apps like FindFace, Clearview, and PimEyes build upon modern smartphones and their cameras. They apply face recognition to large swathes of images, which can be taken in public spaces without the consent of the photograph’s subject. Even more worrying, the anonymity of people in public spaces is now called into question.

			This is not to say that digital cameras are bad. Instead, we must <span class="text-emphasis">think critically</span> about how we can safeguard our emergent technology from adverse consequences that cascade as technology continues to improve. <br><br>

			Signal, for example, offers to blur faces in images to combat the risk of the identification of protesters by law enforcement -- sometimes, there are ways product design can mitigate the risk of civil rights abuses and privacy intrusions.<br><br>

			Making conscious decisions that can <span class="text-emphasis">future-proof</span> our systems against difficult situations in the future is at the center of designing a sustainable system.<br><br>

			The panopticon is the classical example of a design that prioritizes surveillance.

			Bentham described the design as a “new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind.” The design was intended to be used as a blueprint for prisons (which he funded the development of in London during his lifetime), with the goal of also overseeing prison labor. <span class="text-emphasis">Professor Simone Browne</span>, in Dark Matters: On the Surveillance of Blackness, writes of the similarities between Bentham’s panopticon and the design of ships carrying enslaved people. The panopticon is a physical manifestation of implicit structural violence, racism, and exploitation.
			<br><br>
			Since Bentham’s initial thought experiment, the panopticon has been adopted by several prisons around the world (including a few in the US). By 2006 in Amsterdam, Lelystad Prison was called the “first digital panopticon prison,” with inmates tracked by electronic tags and a low guard-to-inmate ratio. How might we protect <strong>against this manipulation through design</strong>?

			Design can be deployed to surveil people (by harvesting their information passively, for example) but can also be used to help people understand how exposed their activity might lead them to be.

			Though communicating this information is one of the purposes of Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policies, they've become so protective against litigation that the language often feels hard to interpret - these privacy labels are a promising approach towards communicating how exactly our data is processed by a data broker, and give users agency to decide if this seems reasonable or not. <br><br>

			For our physical analog here, we'll consider the funhouse. When you know you're about to enter a space where distortion is the norm, the experience of a funhouse might actually be fun.

			You might remember Steve Harvey going <span class="text-emphasis">viral in 2015</span> for announcing the wrong winner for Miss Universe. To his credit, the card he was reading was awfully hard to parse quickly - and for someone under pressure on a big stage, missing the fine print might be easy to do. Good information architecture and an intentional use of visual hierarchy can start to correct for misunderstandings like this.<br><br>
			Can you think of other times when users might be emotional or stressed while using a service? Government services, legal services, taxes, leases... there are many times we might encounter a stressful decision point where the service architecture could absolutely benefit from visual design, not for aesthetics, but for function. <br><br><br>

			Defaults in products are a powerful way to sway the way a user might make decisions. While the <span class="text-emphasis">Default Effect</span> is certainly relevant to this project, here, we're looking at how a defaultpresented inaccurate information. MaxMind, an IP address mapping service, is used by law enforcement and consumers to track devices to a location. When MaxMind can't provide a granular location for an IP address (and even those are estimates), it would instead provide a more general estimate (a city, state or country) -- but with full GPS precision, which sometimes meant estimating an IP at the dead center of the USA. <br><br> 
			A family in remote Kansas was frequently visited by sherrifs and police departments who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/09/maxmind-mapping-lawsuit-kansas-farm-ip-address">believed a family's farm was the site of kidnapped children, stolen cell phones, organized computer fraud, and attempted suicides</a>.
			MaxMind's bad choice of default behavior here not only misrepresents truth (you cannot simply "round" a location up, because that still points to another location) but also demonstrates how technology can portray data to have a <span class="text-emphasis">false sense of precision</span> and seem objective.

			<strong>Gaming design</strong><br><br>
			Bill Friedman was a foundational thinker in strategic casino design - in his seminal text book, he says: "The only relevant consideration for casino design are these: What percentage of visitors gamble? What percentage return to gamble? Nothing else matters."<br><br><br>
			Friedman's <span class="text-emphasis">“Gaming design”</span> philosophy held many principles to its core. Here are a few...<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Principle 2:</strong> Gambling Equipment Immediately Inside Casino Entrances Beats Vacant Entrance Landings and Empty Lobbies</li>
				<li><strong>Principle 4:</strong> The Maze Layout Beats Long, Wide, Straight Passageways and Aisles</li>
				<li><strong>Principle 8:</strong> Low Ceilings Beat High Ceilings</li>
				<li><strong>Principle 9:</strong> Gambling Equipment As the Décor Beats Impressive and Memorable Decorations</li>
				<li><strong>Principle 11:</strong> Pathways Emphasizing the Gambling Equipment Beat the Yellow Brick Road</li>

			<br><br><br><br><br>To Friedman, capturing casino-goers into tight spaces by making it easy to find a casino and difficult to leave one was a central concept to a casino design that maximizes profit. <br><br><br>In our reading of this case study, we will challenge ourselves to think more expansively: how might we increase user agency instead of limit it?

			<strong><span class="text-emphasis">Playground design</span></strong><br><br>
			Of course, casino design has evolved since the 2000s - Roger Thomas and Steve Wynn, while designing for the Belagio, challenged Friedman's assumptions about how to best maximize profit. They predicted that if people were more relaxed, they would be willing to place riskier bets. Lowering their psychological barrier to gambling could produce more efficient gains for a casino. Instead of trapping people, their casinos embraced <span class="text-emphasis">“Playground design” and “evo-catuer”</span> — they stimulate the senses.<br><br><br>
			Here are some properties of their design paradigm:<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Provide ample natural light</li>
				<li>Give people excellent wayfinding - a feeling of agency</li>
				<li>Use high ceilings to create the feeling openness </li>
				<li>Glamorous lobby spaces with sculptures excite the senses</li>
				<li>Maximize comfort</li>
				<li>Instead of entrapping guests in a web of buzzing slot machines, provide clear sightlines to where gamblers want to head next (but make the <strong>right</strong> choice obvious)</li>
			</ul>
			<br><br>
			The designs also speak to guests who might not typically gamble, as their luxurious decor acts as a "type of anesthesia" to numb guests of their significant losses.

			One dark pattern from Friedman's conception (the first kind) of casino design was trapping and building mazes to disorient people, and encourage them to stay within one section of a casino. Removing sightlines or the possibility of leaving encouraged lingering - this pattern is a common digital dark pattern. Let's start with <span class="text-emphasis">e-commerce checkout flows</span>.

			Native advertising leads to similar disorientation (and this overlaps heavily with the misrepresentation section) -- it's the use of embedding advertising in a format that seems native, like an article with a small (and often, easy to miss) advertising label, that mirrors the narrative tone and visual presence of other actual articles. Because they're presented as options among other articles, people may not be aware that they're being led to biased ads. <br><br>

				<li><strong>Nagging</strong>Repeated requests to do something
				<li><strong>Obstruction</strong> Roach motel (asymmetric signup and canceling) • Price comparison prevention • Intermediate currency • Immortal accounts
				<li><strong>Sneaking</strong> Sneak into basket • Hidden costs • Hidden subscription / forced continuity • Bait and switch
				<li><strong>Interface interference </strong> Preselection / aesthetic manipulation • Toying with emotion • False hierarhcy / pressured selling • Disguised ad • Trick questions • Confirmshaming (making a choice seem dishonorable) • Cuteness
				<li><strong>Forced action</strong> Address book leeching • Privacy Zuckering (tricking people into sharing personal info) • Gamification • Forced Registration

			In Roger Thomas and Steve Wynn's "playground design," instead of creating friction, design is strategically used to reduce friction for decisions a system prefers a user to make. <br><br>
			Fanduel and DraftKings, sports gambling services, make a users' first bet free and match deposits - by making the first bets free, users are more likely to continue betting, where any windfall is a source of encouragement and any loss feels negligible because it was free (making you more likely to continue betting). <br><br>

			Netflix's autoplay feature, Youtube's autoplay, and the endless scrolling that many social media services use perform a similar function. By making it easier to continue accessing more content, these seemingly bottomless websites make it increasingly easy to continue spending time on them. <br><br><br>

			Of course, it's worth noting that Netflix eventually check's in on you to ask if you're still watching and Instagram now let's you know that "You're all caught up." These nudges are healthy ways to encourage users to decide to continue spending time consuming, with intention and pause.

			NextDoor is an app that allows neighborhoods to connect online. Though its intentions are to bring communities together, NextDoor's incident reports enabled racial profiling in several communities where black individuals were identified as threats merely for existing in communities. Incident reports previously didn't require supplementary information (many reports would only cite a person's race), but since have been updated to require specific and additional information if race is cited. More recently, NextDoor released features to detect harmful language and warn users about this. Clearly, these problems are not caused by Nextdoor -- they indicate the systemic failures of racist neighborhoods. But building features that enable users to choose and identify those who they don't think belong near their homes enables cascading harmful effects. <Br><br>
			Building more protective features for incident reporting will not solve racism, but will reduce where it is allowed to flourish.

			Fortunately, introducing manual and algorithmic "speed bumps" is a design practice we are already very familiar with. For heavy and often irreversible actions like deletion, many design patterns have users confirm these actions before they are completed. Expanding where these patterns are applicable, not only for technical actions, but social ones can help us design defensively to protect user agency and encourage users to make decisions as active participants.
